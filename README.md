Sure! Here’s a well-structured and informative README that you can use for your "Go Template" project:

# Go Template

This repository provides a simple and reusable **Go Template** to kickstart your Go-based web applications with a fully-configured development environment. It combines the power of **Gin** for the web framework, **Gorm** for ORM and PostgreSQL integration, and **Redis** for caching and other purposes. The setup also includes **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and **Air** for live reloading during development.

This template is designed to help developers quickly set up new Go web projects with essential technologies, so you can focus more on the business logic and less on the boilerplate setup.

## Features

- **Gin** - A lightweight web framework for building APIs.
- **Gorm** - An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with a PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL** - A powerful, open-source relational database.
- **Redis** - A high-performance key-value store for caching.
- **Docker** - Containerize your application for consistent environments across systems.
- **Docker Compose** - Easily configure and manage multi-container Docker applications.
- **Air** - Live reloading during development for faster feedback loops.
  
## Prerequisites

To get started with this template, you’ll need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed for managing multi-container Docker applications.
- A basic understanding of **Go**, **Gin**, **Gorm**, and **Docker**.
